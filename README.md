# About
Welcome to my developer homepage.

Ill use this repository to upload, and delevop, my personal page, or better yet, my web lab!

It will also help me learning the 'GitWay' of managing file versons.

#To Do
- [ ] Total review of the site
- [ ] Make a blog (+/- it as posts!)
- [ ] Search about the #issue1

**Things to add in the site**
- [ ] About page? (there will not be an about page but it can be an about section)
- [ ] Contact page? (could also use some social links and a small *call to action* to contact)
- [x] Blog page (save posts with json files?!)
- [ ] Add more *To Do's*
- [ ] Add css template (use grid, flexbox as needed)
- [x] Use the components method (js files inject the content into the html containers)
- [ ] Should I use some css pre-compiler like sass?

**Thing's that I used**
```
document.querySelector('.myClass');
```
Used instead of 'document.getElementById' for a more clean code.

**Issue's that I found**
- [issue1] When passing the posts content to the DOM with the 'innerHTML' method I found out that if I used a '<p>' tag at the start and end of the full content, it would send to the DOM some empty '<p>' tags along the content... it was strange. have to check this out again!
