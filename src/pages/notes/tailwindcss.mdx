After learning CSS this framework will help you design your layouts faster:

- Don't waste time naming your classes
- ...

## Custom Design System

Update your `tailwind.config.js` file with your design sizes colors, and other variables.
Decide with your team some kind of naming before starting to use this.

```js
module.exports = {
  darkMode: "class",
  content: ["./src/**/*.{astro,html,js,jsx,md,mdx,svelte,ts,tsx,vue}"],
  theme:
    screens:{
      tablet: '960px',
      desktop:'1248px'
    },
    colors:{
      zinc:'#262626',
      orange:'#c2410c'
    }
  },
  plugins: [],
};

```
